## Hi There

Currently working on [Erlang-RED](https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red): *visual low-code flow-based programming environment for Erlang*, insipred by [Node-RED](https://nodered.org).

Before that worked on [FlowHub.org](https://flowhub.org) *visual code version management and sharing*

And creator of the first *visualisation* of Node-RED flows outside of Node-RED - [flowviewer](https://github.com/gorenje/node-red-flowviewer-js).

I have a thing for visual coding ;)
